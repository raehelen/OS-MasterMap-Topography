<br>
How often is the OS MasterMap Topography Layer updated?
<br>
<br>
All OS MasterMap® datasets are created from a single master dataset, which is refreshed regularly. Currently, the refresh period for Topography Layer supply is every six weeks (view release schedule).
<br>
<br>
OS MasterMap Topography Layer works on the principle that you will take an initial supply of all data in your area of interest and then update the data by taking change-only update (COU).
<br>
<br>
COU brings your dataset up to date with the most recent OS MasterMap data available from Ordnance Survey.
<br>
<br>
The update of real world features within OS MasterMap Topography Layer depends on what Category of change the feature falls in, as described in our Basic scale revision pollcy.

<details>
<summary>What scale is OS MasterMap Topography Layer data??</summary>
<br>
For cartographic representation, OS MasterMap Topography Layer is captured and designed for display at 1:1250, 1:2500 and 1:10 000 scales in urban, rural and mountain/moorland areas respectively. In GIS OS MasterMap can be viewed over a considerable range of scales. The most scale-sensitive feature types, such as cartographic text and symbol features, are fixed in size and rapidly become less clear at smaller display scales (that is, when zoomed out).
<br>
<br>
OS MasterMap Topography Layer is also suitable for use in non–cartographic applications where the concept of scale is less applicable.
